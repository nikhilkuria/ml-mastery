#### note

In case of SSL error when downloading models from mac, make sure you have installed the SSL certificates.

When you run the python installer, they display this information to you. It is also documented in /Applications/Python 3.6/ReadMe.rtf, but it's very easily overlooked.

Just browse to Applications/Python 3.6 and double-click Install Certificates.command

There is an issue in the Python bug tracker about this. http://bugs.python.org/issue29480
